# R389: the uniform subgroup Wick budget is false for every constant

`R389WickBudgetSupBound.UniformSubgroupWickBudget C` asks for one inflation constant `C` such that
the DC-subtracted Wick budget holds for *every* finite field and *every* torsion subgroup at the
calibrated depth `k* = ⌈(log q)/2⌉₊`.  Its docstring records a subfield obstruction as a written
argument, "not kernel-checked".  This file kernel-checks it: `¬ UniformSubgroupWickBudget C` for
every real `C`.

## The argument

* `C ≥ 0`.  Take a prime `p` and `F = GF(p²)`.  The torsion set `μ_{p-1} ⊂ F` contains the
  `p - 1` nonzero elements of the prime subfield (`pred_le_card_torsionSet`).  It lies in the
  proper additive subgroup `{x : x^p = x}`, so some nontrivial — hence primitive — additive
  character of `F` is identically `1` on it
  (`FFModelW4.ffThin_prizeLaw_countermodel`): the period `η_1` equals `|μ_{p-1}|`.  The R389
  consumer `sup_le_three_sqrt_of_dcEnergyBudget` turns the budget into
  `|μ_{p-1}| ≤ 3·√(C·|μ_{p-1}|·log q)`, i.e. `|μ_{p-1}| ≤ 9·C·log q`
  (`card_torsionSet_le_of_budget`).  With `q = p²` and `log p ≤ 2(√p - 1)` this gives
  `√p + 1 ≤ 36·C`, false once `p > (36·⌈C⌉₊)²`.
* `C < 0`.  At `F = ZMod 2`, `d = 1` the depth is `k* = 1`, the right-hand side `2·C` is
  negative, and the left-hand side is nonnegative by the DC floor.

## Scope

The witness is a subfield subgroup: `μ_{p-1} = GF(p)^×` inside `GF(p²)`, where there is no
cancellation at all.  This refutes the *uniform* statement over all finite fields.  It says
nothing about prime fields or about the prize-shaped subgroups `μ_{2^k} ⊂ 𝔽_p`, for which the
budget remains open in both directions, exactly as the R389 docstring states.
